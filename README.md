A TicTacToe is developed using the knowledge of data structures and algorithms. It is developed in such a way that the computer cannot lose the game, either it will win or it will be a draw.
Minmax function is implemented using backtracking that helps the computer to process the next possible steps that can be taken by a user and it comes back to the current step.
